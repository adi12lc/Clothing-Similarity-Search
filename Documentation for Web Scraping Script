# Documentation for Web Scraping Script

The following documentation details a Python script that uses Beautiful Soup and Requests library to scrape Amazon product information, including product title, detailed description, product rating, number of reviews, and product URL.

## Libraries

1. `requests`: This library is used to send HTTP requests to a given URL and receive HTML responses.
2. `BeautifulSoup`: This library is used to parse the HTML content and extract the required information from the HTML elements and their attributes.
3. `pandas`: This is a data manipulation and analysis library. It's used to create a DataFrame from the scraped data and to write this data into a CSV file.
4. `re`: This is Python's built-in Regular Expression library used to extract numeric ratings from string.
5. `numpy`: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Code Workflow

1. We first define a headers dictionary `HEADERS` which includes the User-Agent and Accept-Language. These headers are sent with each HTTP request to mimic a real web browser.

2. `make_soup(url)`: A helper function to send HTTP request to a given URL and parse the HTML response into a BeautifulSoup object. The function handles request exceptions and returns None if an exception occurs.

3. `get_title(soup)`: Extracts the product title from the BeautifulSoup object. If it's unable to find the title, it returns an empty string.

4. `get_detaildescription(soup)`: Extracts the product description from the BeautifulSoup object. If it's unable to find the description, it returns an empty string.

5. `get_rating(soup)`: Extracts the product rating from the BeautifulSoup object. If it's unable to find the rating, it tries to find it in a different HTML element. If it still can't find it, it returns an empty string.

6. `get_review_count(soup)`: Extracts the number of product reviews from the BeautifulSoup object. If it's unable to find the review count, it returns an empty string.

7. In the `main()` function, we specify the URL of the Amazon webpage from which we want to scrape product data. We call `make_soup(URL)` to get a BeautifulSoup object for this webpage.

8. We extract all product links on the webpage using BeautifulSoup's `find_all()` method and save them in `links_list`.

9. We loop through `links_list` and for each link, we call `make_soup()` again to get a BeautifulSoup object for that product's webpage. We then call our helper functions to extract the product's title, description, rating, review count, and URL. We use list comprehension to construct a list of dictionaries `product_data` where each dictionary contains data for one product.

10. We convert `product_data` into a pandas DataFrame and remove any rows where the product title is empty or NaN. We then write this DataFrame into a CSV file "web_data.csv".

## Note
Make sure to replace the placeholder URL and User-Agent in the script with actual values before running it. Also, respect Amazon's robots.txt file and use web scraping responsibly. Be aware that excessive scraping may lead to your IP being temporarily or permanently blocked by Amazon. It's recommended to add time delays between your requests to avoid such issues.
